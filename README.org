* reactlab

This started as a place to do random reactjs stuff, but it's turning into a web-based version of [[http://www.templetons.com/brad/alice.html][alice pascal]], an old syntax-directed editor for pascal.

* installation

First, clone this repo locally and install [[http://vagrantup.com/][vagrant]].

Then:

: cd reactlabs
: vagrant up

Once vagrant is done provisioning the server:

: vagrant ssh

Then from the vagrant shell:

: cd /vagrant
: nodemon serve.js

Note that you're running the generated =*.js= file, /not/ the source =*.cjsx= file.

You can now load the app in your web browser:

  [[http://localhost:8086]]

When you're done:

: vagrant halt

to shut down the virtual machine, or

: vagrant destroy

to completely remove it.
